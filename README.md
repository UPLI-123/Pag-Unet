# Pag-Unet
##  :scroll: Introduction
This directory contains codes of our paper Pag-Unet:
- Pag-Unet uses an efficient multidimensional feature aggregation method to solve the problem of using naive operations to aggregate features in current multitasking transform models, which cannot efficiently utilize the features obtained by encoders.
- Pag-Unet proposed a new personalized self attention method.
- nvPT achieves superior performance on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets respectively, and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.

    <em>InvPT enables jointly learning and inference of global spatial interaction and simultaneous all-task interaction, which is critically important for multi-task dense prediction.</em>
